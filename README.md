# SimpleHashing
SimpleHashing is a library made on top of `System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes`.
SimpleHashing makes hashing easy.

# Security
SimpleHashing use a random generated salt of 16 bytes.
A random salt protect you for rainbowtables.
To prevent from bruteforce attacks, you can change the Iterations value.
Higher Iterations will change the time to create a hash.(Default = 50000)(Higher takes more time)
